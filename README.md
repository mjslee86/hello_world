### Hello, World!

This is my introduction to the world of Github.com.
My current goals mainly revolve around teaching myself
how to program, by actually doing some coding along
with the tutorials I'll be using. It is likely to be
a long and difficult task, but with determination may
even seem fairly easy to move forward.

I'm excited to get this started, and hope to have some
good contributions within a relatively short amount of
time. Maybe even start some interesting projects myself
to share with the rest of the world.
